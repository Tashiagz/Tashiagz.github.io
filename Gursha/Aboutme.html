		<p>I knew I always wanted to create. You could hand me a piece of paper and a pen- and I could create a whole universe (dimensions)- I learned to live in my own world. A world full of rock music, nature, meditation, Golden age films, and Betesebi. Betesebi is the Amharic word for FAMILY. I've always had a great support system since I was a child.</p>
		<p>I call my family home, &#8220The Village,&#8221 because that's how we operate. My betesebi had our own talents and capabilities. My sister was the genius who always was on top of her game, my mom was the backbone who always deescalated problems, and I was the creator. Hand me anything and I can transform it, but it was my sister&#8217s creations that helped me grow. My Beta. My omega. My beta taught me understanding, confidence, and how to be fearless, and my omega taught me patience, comic, and hard work. Looking at the world through my betesebi's eyes really gave me a new perspective of beauty. We&#8217re a team that grew together.</p>
		<p>My pack prepared me for something even more important. I have three scars on my head from when I was a child. Two on my skull and one above my eyebrow. I&#8217d swing off shower curtains and bunk beds thinking I was Tarzan. I skateboard, I listen to rock music, run across the roof of my house, I was always fearless. But that changed when she came. My cub. She&#8217s only three and I can tell she&#8217s going to be just as careless as me. Who would of thought that the one fear I had was my cub getting hurt.</p> 
		<p>All of them are a piece of me. This is my dimension. My World. My Betesebi (Family). My Family is the reason I create, and each project I work on I keep in mind that businesses, brands, and marketing campaigns are always going to be aimed towards a creator, a genius, a mother, nieces, nephews, children, and their loved ones.</p>
<p> I created Gursha to create brands and marketing strategies for people willing to develop something as unique as them. We all have our own stories and ideas, but how we share them with the world is what makes the difference.</p>
