		<h1>Tash&#8217s Domain</h1>
		<p>I am a child of a Castillian mother and an Ethiopian Father. My mother was born in 1958, a time when interracial relationships were still frowned upon. Yet my mother recognized the beauty of African skin and spit at the idea of segregation. So, when she met my father, and saw his beautiful black skin, she loved him enough to make me. I am Natashia Monique Gebre-Zion, and I am a symbol of love and equality.</p>

		<p>I knew I always wanted to create. You could hand me a piece of paper and a pen- and I could create a whole universe (dimensions)- I learned to live in my own world. A world full of rock music, nature, meditation, and golden age films. But, despite how beautiful this universe was- It needed something... I guess cupid heard my whispers, because she came. My rock! My spirit guide. I&#8217ll never forget the way she&#8217d watch me. She was amazed with this world I created like it was magic. So- I let her in. She listened to my story. She taught me— and learned with me. It wasn&#8217t long before I knew it was time to take her to the village.</p>
		<p>I call my family, &#8220The Village&#8221. Even my closest friends refer to it as The Village. We all had our own talents and capabilities. My sister was the genius who always was on top of her game, my mom was the backbone who always deescalated problems, and I was the creator. Hand me anything and I can transform it, but it was my sister&#8217s creations that help me grow. My Beta. My omega. My beta taught me understanding, confidence, and how to be fearless, and my omega taught me patience, comic, and hard work. My beta, I&#8217ll never forget the first time I introduced her to a skateboard. I was more afraid than her, but she got on that board and mastered those curbs. That should have been the first sign that she was unstoppable, but like most things- I thought she&#8217d grow out of it. I was wrong, a couple of years later she was out there showing me there is nothing she can&#8217t do. Playing basketball, being a cheerleader, cpr certified at 12 years old, she’s even expected to be a doctor by the age of 27. She even challenged me on my own homework. Looking at the world through her eyes really gave me a new perspective of beauty. We&#8217re a team that grew together. Then omega came. I didn’t except to love her the same way as my Beta, and I didn&#8217t. Instead I found a new way to love her. She&#8217d grab the things I hated and would teach me how to love them. Who would have thought a weed can become a beautiful flower.</p>
		<p>My pack prepared for something even more important. I have 3 scars on my head from when I was a child. Two on my skull and one above my eyebrow. I&#8217d swing off shower curtains and bunk beds thinking I was Tarzan. I skateboard, I listen to rock music, run across the roof of my house, I was always fearless. But that changed when she came. My cub. She&#8217s only three and I can tell she&#8217s going to be just as careless as me. Climbing on shit she shouldn&#8217t be climbing on, running around without a shirt, and always jumping. Who would of thought that the one fear I had was my cub getting hurt.</p> 
		<p>This is my dimension. My dimension is defined by Betesebi (Family). From my mom raising me to being a mom raising my own cub.</p>
